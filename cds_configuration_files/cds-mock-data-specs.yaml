#Relationship specifications. For example: how many studies per program; how many cases per studies.
# This also includes specifications on how these node counts should be generated.
# 1. SrcNodeCount: fixed, indicates that the "count" variable holds the counts.
# 2. SrcNodeCount: random, indicates that counts are generated from a drawing from a uniform distribution 
# 3. All relationships among the included nodes will automatically be created.
# 4. Do not specify relationships between nodes of the same type, e.g between two samples, two visits etc.
