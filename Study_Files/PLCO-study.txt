study	"The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial"	PLCO	PLCO	"phs001094.v1.p1, phs001286.v3.p2"	"The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial is a randomized, controlled trial of screening tests for prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers. Approximately 155,000 participants were enrolled between November 1993 and July 2001. Participants were individually randomized to the control arm or intervention arm in equal proportions. Participants assigned to the control arm received usual care, whereas participants assigned to the intervention arm were invited to receive screening exams for prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers as outlined in the study protocol. The goal of the study was to assess whether these screening exams reduce mortality from prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers. Data were collected on cancer diagnoses through 2009 (median follow-up time 11.3 years) and mortality through 2018 (median-follow-up 19.2 years).

In 2009 the NCI decided to expand data collection on PLCO participants beyond the initial study design in order to acquire more cancer outcomes and continue to track mortality. This required the remaining PLCO participants to be contacted and reconsented. The outcome of the reconsenting was that approximately 83,500 active participants who were willing to continue study activities, with approximately 21,000 participants who were passively followed, and a total of approximately 136,000 participants (active, passive, or dead) who were eligible for additional linkages with cancer registries and the National Death Index."
